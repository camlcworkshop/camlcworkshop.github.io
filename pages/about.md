### The CAMLC25 workshop
<p align="justify">

The second edition of the "Cheminformatics, Automation and Machine Learning in Chemistry: from fundamental concepts to emerging techniques" (or CAMLC for short) workshop aims to introduce attendees to the use and development of emerging digital technologies in chemistry. Initially, attendees will review various functions of Python, particularly those related to modules commonly used in cheminformatics. Once users are familiar with Python environments and Jupyter Notebooks, machine learning and data science will be introduced, with a focus on state-of-the-art implementations in the field of chemistry. It is particularly relevant for attendees who work with the following:</p>

* Homogeneous or finite systems<br>
<i>Note: the workshop is not recommended for researchers working on PBC-materials or MD-enzymes)</i><br>
* Machine learning modeling<br>
* Database generation<br>
* Gaussian and ORCA calculations<br>
* Quantum mechanics and machine learning automated workflows<br>
* Applications to catalyst design, mechanistic modeling, and drug discovery<br>

<br>

### Requirements

* Basic level of computational chemistry. Preferably, applicants should be familiar with using Gaussian or ORCA and running jobs with bash or SLURM scripts
* Good command of English (language of the workshop)
* Participants must bring their own laptops to follow the workshop
* Sessions are in-person only

<br>

### Recommended skills

* Basic level of Python or other computing languages
