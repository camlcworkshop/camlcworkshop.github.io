<!-- ### Funding agencies

<p align="justify">Thanks to the <a href='https://geqc.rseq.org/'>Computers in Chemistry Group (GEQC) of the Spanish Royal Society of Chemistry (RSEQ)</a>, students are benefiting from very low registration fees that cover their stays at the <a href='https://resijaca.unizar.es/'>Residencia Universitaria de Jaca</a> and their meals. Additionally, GEQC members receive a 30 EUR discount on their fees.</p>

<p align="justify">Thanks to the <a href='https://colegioquimicos.com/'>Colegio de Químicos de la Comunidad Valenciana</a>, two students will be awarded travel grants of 80 EUR each.</p>

<p aligh="justify"> Thanks to the <a href='https://delegacion.aragon.csic.es/'>Delegación CSIC en Aragón</a> for allowing us to use their venue, which has substantially reduced the tuition price for all students.</p><br>

<p aligh="justify">Thanks to the <a href='https://stara.rseq.org/'>Sección territorial de Aragón de la RSEQ</a>, one student will secure a spot to attend the workshop with a 50 EUR discount.</p> -->

### Become a sponsor

<p aligh="justify">All the funding received from sponsorships will be allocated to reducing the registration fees for students. All sponsor logos will be displayed in a list presented before the workshop (as part of event promotion) and during all sessions, categorized into three sponsorship levels:</p>
